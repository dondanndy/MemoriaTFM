ABSTRACT = {Millimeter wave technology will be dominating the fifth-generation networks due to the clear advantage of higher frequency bands and hence wider spectrum. In this paper, the indoor radio wave propagation at 28 GHz is studied by developing an efficient three-dimensional ray tracing (ETRT) method. The simulation software based on the ETRT model has been verified by measurement data. The received signal strength indication and path loss have shown significant agreement between simulation and measurement. Compared with the conventional shooting bouncing ray tracing method, the proposed ETRT method has better agreement with measurement data.},
